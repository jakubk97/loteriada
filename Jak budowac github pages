jak budowaÄ‡ na github pages? 

ngh --dir dist/[PROJECTNAME] takes the specified build directory dist/[PROJECTNAME] and publishes it to the gh-pages branch (if not specified differently).
However, when publishing to GH Pages under a subfolder you also need to set the base href accordingly at build time:

ng build --prod --base-href=/[projectname]/

Otherwise your browser will try to find the application bundles in the domain root and not in the subfolder. Note the leading and trailing slash, they are important.
There is no need to set the base href when you deploy to a domain root without sub folder.
